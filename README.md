# go primes


## This is a program that generates primes

We dont need to generate primes, but its a tool to learn go,
And, maybe, a tool for BDD, or Testing, or other things.

v1: the simplest. Start at 3, divide by every number possible

v2: add signals so I can catch an interrupt, and goroutine, so I can loop until I do.
